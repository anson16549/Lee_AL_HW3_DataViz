# The Olympics Data Analyzation

Firstly, I choose to analyze the data in Canada's Olmpics history. I research "How many gold medals have Canada won so far", "Which medals are won the most", Compared to other countries, is Canada above the average or not. Secondly, I create six graphs to prove and show the result based on the data which is approved online.
